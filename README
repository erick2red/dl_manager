================= dl_manager =================
The best way of describe it is using it.
With it you can:
1. Add new url to be downloaded on the server.
2. Retrieve the downloaded files.
3. Remove the urls you want.

So far has some requirements I will list later.
Out of my memory
apache/php and some php extensions
youtube-dl for downloading youtube videos
curl and sqlite3

================= TODO =================
1. Add url description
2. Add url file type
3. Add user/pass to url
