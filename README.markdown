# dl_manager

#### What is this:
* The best way of describe it is using it.

#### With it you can:
* Add new url to be downloaded on the server
* Retrieve the downloaded files
* Remove the urls you want
* Add text file with links to get all the links
    
#### Requirements
* Apache
* PHP (php extensions: json, curl, sqlite3)
* Python3 (Here, I said Python3 cause I made it with Python3 not cause I rely on any particular feature not available in previous versions. You will need to migrate dl\_manager\_service script if want to use Python2)
* Python3 modules: sqlite3, re, urllib, os, subprocess (I do know this are core python modules, but ...)
* [youtube-dl](href="http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl) to download video from youtube
